***3.0.0.30***
* MAJOR BUG FOUND: Ascii emulator is corrupted when displaying NULL (0x00). This bug is probably in all V3
        HACK: Display 0xFE when NULL is received. Best to use Hex emulator if you need to see his accurately.
* Change to DisplayAs selector - Fewer items,
        Added Int32/Uint32
        signed/unsigned selected by radiobuttons
        Commandline values have changed - now -ve values can be used get Int8,16,32 and HexSpace
        Hex [space] : space checkbox (-ve to have not space)
* Add custom datetime format to capture. Response to bug#74, which is not a bug, but default system.locale format being used
        Existing behaviour of YMDHS is left in same position, but renamed System, so Timstamp=4 still behaves same
        Edit field by right mouse click/dblclick on radio buttons
        Can use cmline param Timestamp="<format line>"
        show example datetime on statusline when changed
        refactor: move all datetime formatting into a separate unit
* Add Custom format to DisplayTimestamp. right-click on *TimeStamp* to edit.
* Now finds ports up to COM9999 (was 100) bug#69
* CRLF on commandline fixed bug#71. Also found this was setting CR param at same time.
* Key-code changes in terminal to make more logical and regular in all emulators
        Change BACKSPACE and DELETE key behaviour to send BS and DEL (fix bug#64)
        add NULL key ^@ and ^space
        ENTER->CR, shift+ENTER->CRLF, ^ENTER->LF Ansi/VT100 now same.
        (note ^C is trapped for copy before it gets to emulator, so you still have to use button on send tab)
* CRC improved(feature request#38)
        Add XOR8 crc
        Add HEX output of CRC (for ascii data eg NMEA)
        NMEA message added
        EOL CR&LF are now outside CRC (both for bin and hex crc's)
        CRC commandline param added (-ve=hex)
        Added optional CRCType to ActiveX.PutString(S,SendAs,CRCType)
* Load Keymaps. Separate Keymaps for VT100/Ansi (KEYMAPVT) and the other terminals (KEYMAP)
        This allows remapping of keyboards, adding custom multi-char keys ie macros
        New commandline params KEYMAPVT=<fname> and KEYMAP=<fname>
* Change \NNN Escape sequences in send changed.
        Now 1-3 decimal/octal chars can be used correctly per python.
        see: https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/strings.html
        Now easy change to use either decomal or octal. What do users want?
        If you want to revert to the old behaviour or support the change
                go to https://sourceforge.net/p/realterm/feature-requests/41/
* Fix to commandline handler to accept " inside strings eg send1="abc=""def""" (bug#72)
        Should have no effect, but might affect some commandlines.
        The INI writer has been improved to quote strings when saving, and when necessary
* SendNum,SendHex,SendAscii buttons ALL respect +CR,+LF,+CRC now
        Refactoring: The code that sends strings and handles comboboxes has been
        reorganised. Look out for bugs that might have been introduced. A single routine now sends strings
* TSDELIMITER param correctly displays & if used as delimiter.
* VERSION param added to generated ini/param files so you can see what version an old fiel was created with
* Refactoring of FileChoose buttons to all use common code.
        environment variables in filenames expanded by filechoose
* Add exit on CTS timeout.
* Fix - remove double "CPS:" in sendfile progress report

        param CAPPROCESS=<batch file>
* Add BLE module support for I2C2PC-BLE and HM10,11,15

* remove ^C hotkey - obviously interferes with copying from UI
* Port Combobox:
        Add [Exhaustive Search by Opening] to allow finding ports# not listed in the registry.
        select now changes port immediately.
        add [CLEAR] to end of dropdown
* sort parameter list for help on INIFILE dialog

* Add FONTNAME FONTSIZE commandline parameters. (resize on font change)
* fixing: Bug#52,#60 Raised sendfile rate from approx 1200CPS to >100kBps MAX
        Changed the timer from 20Hz to 100Hz, and made block size much bigger.
        Char Delay now also sets block size, therefore send rate. See help for more details.
        These changs significant for USB and TCP ports especially.
        Default is about 8kBps
        change AsciiProtocol block 60->1023
        change Outbuffer to 65520 from 16k
        change InBufferFull to 10k, Resume to 2k, inbuffer=65520

* fix: Bug#51, 0x1A added to send files of length 8160-8192
* fix: If SendFileName is a DIR, now OpenDialog opens to that DIR (before: error msg)
* OnEventXXX has if ... and (Fevent<>nil) removed, so main handler can report message if fevent is nil
* ActiveX/COM Event Changes
        Datapacket timeout default set to 0 (no timeout)
        Timeout event now supported - sends data trigger with timeout=true; clears checkbox, reports Enabled correctly
        events tab now shows all events sent
        SetDataTrigger now enables immediately if Autoenable=true
        Setting Port now error trapped, same as port open, so no errors.
* Add LazyDisplay checkbox for terminal, for char-by-char response (fix bug#44)
        Oddly, this seems to work better at very high data rates, where the terminal normally blocks/stalls
* Add CommandLine parameter SENDFNAME to set file(s) without sending.
* fix: Move and shrink button panel to uncover events tab

***3.0.0.26***  21May15

* Resizing completly functional: Terminal changes on Drag resize, maxmimize, normal etc.
        Clips to screen when started on tiny (netbook screens) or scaled.
* Add Terminal ScrollUP and scrollDOWN hotkeys
* Add CRLF checkbox. Makes ENTER button send CRLF instead of CR
        New cmdline param CRLF to set it.
* Change ROWS on drag resize. ROWs now sets min size. Cols are not changed except in miniterminal
* Set COLS to screenwidth with double-click on COLS - great for fullscreen
* MiniTerminal fixes: correctly setting StayOnTop. StatusBar always stays at bottom. Sizing now correct.
        Size and Position of Miniterminal are saved
* New SendFile and OpenPort hotkeys/menus
* Windowing minor fixes
        Added Snap to Screen edge (25 pixels) Feature request if this annoys you, or size is wrong.
        remove ghost buttons,
        fix scrollbar min size problem,
        move hexcsvpanel to right place
* Fixed Icon animation. Now Icon shows state by color:
        Green=PortOpen, Cyan=Winsock waiting, Red=Capture, Yellow=Sync/DataTrigger, Magenta=Send
        incoming chars makes animation rotate
        Important in Miniterminal to see what is happening especially with hotkey port open
        Changed old TrayIcon component to Delphi TTrayIcon. Code totally changed. Active property no longer exists?? use visible instead May have effect on ActX property??
* Fixed Winsock/Telnet server reconnect.
        Now OPEN button pops out on winsock client disconnect or non-connect
* Added Winsock error handler, lights Error light, and sets error code to hint.
* Fixed:Added xx.free and destructors to stop lost memory errors in debugger on exit
        Started attacking "harmless" compiler warnings.
* Added: Port string added to TrayIcon Hint.

*3.0.0.25* 14May15

* Fix Return key: Now works correctly: Return=CR, Ctrl+Return=LF, Shift+Return=CRLF, also hotkey ctrl+alt+enter=CRLF
* Local Hotkeys now working in Terminal. There are now many useful hotkeys, study the popup menu to learn them
* Added MiniTerminal mode that shrinks Realterm and keeps it on top.
        This makes it easy to watch the output from something while working on something else.
* AutoCopy in terminal - when a block is marked with the mouse it is copied to clipboard as you mark it
* Remove CRLF added by Copy to Clipboard to every marked string
* FIRST appwndproc hook changed so multiple calls don't block old handler. FIRST=0 unhooks now
* Updated links on About page to point correctly to current sourceforge settings
* Add StayOnTop menu item. StayOnTop only works while windowstate is normal

***3.0.0.24*** 12May15

* Timestamps in terminal. Works with ascii, and binary sync modes (not ANSI mode - makes no sense
        User feadback needed on how well this meets user needs, before I take it further. Goto FeatureRequests
        ASCII mode shows timestamp on EOL char - like Capture does.
        Sync mode, shows timestamp on sync match
        highlights timestamp always in ASCII mode, controlled by Highlght in sync mode
        Highlights an extra char beyond timestamp - this is a fn of how it works, significant effort to change this
* Sync Chars mode extended with Blanking. This allows you to see sync blocks
        that are sparse. (feature request#14)
        "Show Count" sets number of words to display after a frame sync, after that
        further chars are blanked until next sync.
        -1=Show words from frame sync until next EOL char (CR or LF), then blank
* Reverse video highlighting of the sync postion added.
* Add menuitems and hotkeys to send strings on send tab. F10,F11,^F10,^F11
        Global hotkeys (windows-systemwide) working (manually set on from memu)
        local hotkeys not: Terminal swallows all local hotkeys when it has focus.
* fix Modbus16 CRC
* Fix send to first instance. Now you must explicitly enable it with FIRST=1 on first instance
        Now checking for UIPI blocks after send.
        Added first=2 parameter for first instance to open UIPI protection if error5 occurs from sending instance
* New statusbarhint property ensure all statushints do go to expandend simpletext as well
* bump actx library version to 1.2
3.0.0.23
*  Change tooltip on Sendfile->LineDelay to correctly say EOL char is LF (ox0A), not CR. The change to LF happened at 2.0.0.19
*  Size scaling to make it readable  on small high pixel screens.
        SCALE SIZE control is on misc tab, and popup menu items added.
        Autoscale to fill screen
        SCALE command line parameter and ActX params added
*  Full-Screen mode added [WindowState=3] (useful for small screens like tablets)
        Hidden under the ScaleSize popup menu item
        (todo: interaction between fullscreen and scale.
                set fullscreen from actx, & all windowstates from commandline
*  WindowState cmdline param added. =NORM,MIN,MAX,FULL or 0-3
*  Checkbox to control timer events in activeX to make debugging easier
*  Background color of terminal is set for ansi emulator.
*  BL233 Pin bit bash buttons addded pin#'s to hints
*  Added utility NowStr and example batch file for daily-named datalogging files
*  Fix to TAB cmdline param.
        Works correctly with PORT tab(which has & shortcut)
        Now accepts Tab number as well as name (1=first tab)
*  ClearTerminalOnPortOpen checkbox added.
        Cmdline param CLEAR added Value is sum of 1=DisplayChange,2=PortChange,4=PortOpen
*  Winsock actx property added
*  Added MSGBOX="" placeholder to generated INIFILE
*  Added STRING1, STRING2 cmdline params to load the SendString comboboxes.
        Top 5 lines of comboboxes are now output into INIFILE
        SENDSTR is depreciated, and in future version will change to actually sending the string, not loading the combobox
*  INIFile dialog: fix test where 1st param was ignored.
        Added TestSelected button. Also dblClick on a line will test that line now.
*  Fix: parameter parser was ignoring first param in local strings.
        This would have made remote commandlines ignore the 1st param
        Add Application.MainFormOnTaskbar := True; Makes INI dialog stay in front, hopefully causing no other strange behaviour in main form
*  CodeSigned with new certificate.
